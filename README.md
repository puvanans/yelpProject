This app will consume data from the yelp API

The rough idea in the beginning is subject to change as the project proceeds.

The purpose of this project is to make use of OOP principles (PHP) and API communication.
Exchange of data with the yelp fusion api server is to be achieved using cURL PHP library.
This project will be unit tested and phpUnit is the framework of choice at the moment(subject to change).


As of this moment, the idea is to take user input (zipcode) and return the best rated coffee shop in their vicinity.

For this purpose we will be making use of the yelp API to procure data regarding the coffee shop in the user's area.
